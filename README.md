pnpm i farmup
```

or install global

pnpm i -g farmup
```

## Get Started

run js/ts file

```shell
farmup index.ts
```

run html file, because `farm` is used, even if it is html, it will automatically compile the referenced js and ts files.

```shell
farmup index.html
```

build and exec, but it can only-build

```shell
farmup build index.ts

# only-build
farmup build index.ts --no-exec
```

## roadmap
